## The Mission & Founder Story  

The challenge in African tech education isn't a lack of courses; it's a lack of reliable guidance and verifiable success in placement.

> ‚ÄúI‚Äôm building the platform I wish existed when I was trying to find my way.‚Äù  

**SkillWorth** is a marketplace and mentorship platform designed by a **Business Intelligence Specialist** to address the issue of undirected learning.  
We transform the African skill-to-job gap from a manual search process into a **predictive, measurable career path** powered by analytics.

## The Data Moat (Our Competitive Edge)

We are not a traditional platform that just lists mentors.  
We are an **Intelligence Engine** built on the belief that **quality scales through data, not manual effort.**

| Problem (Current EdTech) | SkillWorth's Analytical Solution |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Guesswork & Low ROI** | **Predictive Placement Score (PPS):** A data model that uses real mentorship outcomes, learner engagement data, and global hiring trends to predict placement success rates for different learning paths. |
| **Unreliable Quality** | **Measurable Mentor Efficacy:** Mentors are ranked and matched based on verifiable, long-term learner success metrics (time-to-placement, salary lift). |
| **Undirected Learning** | **Analytical Thinking Focus:** Learning pathways explicitly designed to develop data-driven problem-solving mindsets, leveraging the founder's BI expertise. |

## MVP Strategy: The Concierge Validation

We are currently running a **Concierge MVP** ‚Äî a high-touch, profitable service model ‚Äî to manually execute and validate the core matching logic.  
This approach allows us to collect the **proprietary data** (mentor feedback, learner success logs, market pricing) needed to train the future automated platform.

**Revenue Hypothesis:** Early mentor-mentee matching fees and B2B partnerships with training institutions for verified talent pipelines.

### Immediate Focus (The Data Commit)
This repository focuses on defining the project‚Äôs **non-negotiable data and system requirements** before coding begins:

* `data_model_v0.1.md`: Defines the essential data schema (Learner Profile, Mentor Efficacy Metrics, Session Logs).  
* `analytics_spec.txt`: Outlines inputs and desired outputs for the **Predictive Placement Score (PPS)** algorithm.  
* `architecture_notes.md`: Early exploration of tech stack options (MERN, Python/Django, etc.) and deployment strategy.
