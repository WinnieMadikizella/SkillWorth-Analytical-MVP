# SkillWorth-Analytical-MVP
A data-optimized mentorship marketplace solving the skill-to-job gap for African tech talent.

# SkillWorth: The Analytical Path to Tech Careers

**Tagline:** **SkillWorth - Your Net Worth is Your Skillset**

## The Mission & Founder Story

The challenge in African tech education isn't a lack of courses; it's a lack of reliable guidance and verifiable placement success.

> “I’m building the platform I wish existed when I was trying to find my way.”
>
> **SkillWorth** is a marketplace and mentorship platform engineered by a **Business Intelligence Specialist** to solve the problem of undirected learning. We transform the African skill-to-job gap from a manual search process into a **predictive, measurable career path** powered by analytics.

## The Data Moat (Our Competitive Edge)

We are not a traditional platform that just lists mentors. We are an **Intelligence Engine** built on the belief that **quality scales through data, not manual effort.**

| Problem (Current EdTech) | SkillWorth's Analytical Solution |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Guesswork & Low ROI** | **Predictive Placement Score (PPS):** Our core algorithm (to be built) will use performance and market data to score the likelihood of a job placement for every mentorship path. |
| **Unreliable Quality** | **Measurable Mentor Efficacy:** Mentors are ranked and matched based on the verifiable, long-term success metrics of their learners (time-to-placement, salary lift). |
| **Undirected Learning** | **Analytical Thinking Focus:** Learning pathways are explicitly structured to develop data-driven problem-solving mindsets, leveraging the founder's BI expertise. |

## MVP Strategy: The Concierge Validation

We are currently running a **Concierge MVP**—a high-touch, profitable service model—to manually execute and validate the core matching logic. This manual process is designed to collect the necessary proprietary data (mentor feedback, learner success logs, market pricing) to train the future automated platform.

### Immediate Focus (The Data Commit)

This initial repository focuses entirely on defining the project's non-negotiable requirements before any code is written.

* `data_model_v0.1.md`: Documenting the essential data schema for the marketplace (e.g., Learner profile fields, Mentor Efficacy Metrics, Session Log fields).
* `analytics_spec.txt`: Defining the inputs and desired outputs for the **Predictive Placement Score (PPS)** algorithm.
* `architecture_notes.md`: Early exploration of tech stack options (MERN, Python/Django, etc.) and deployment strategy.
